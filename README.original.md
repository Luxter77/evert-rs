This directory contains the C++ program "evert" for turning the sphere

inside out without tears, creases, or pinches. The program was written
by Nathaniel Thurston, and is based on ideas of Bill Thurston.
Silvio Levy wrote the documentation and organized the distribution.

This software was developed at the Geometry Center (University of Minnesota).

The documentation consists of a Latex file manual.tex, also available
in Postscript (manual.ps).  It assumes you are familiar with the basic
ideas of the algorithm for turning the sphere inside out described in
the computer-animated video Outside In.  This video, directed by
Silvio Levy, Tamara Munzner and Delle Maxwell, gives an elementary
description of the eversion, and shows it step by step, from different
points of view. You should also consult the full-color illustrated
book Making Waves: A Guide to the Ideas Behind Outside In, which comes
with the video.  Outside In and Making Waves are distributed by
